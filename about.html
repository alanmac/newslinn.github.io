                                Newslinn is a network for citizens and organisations to follow, share and chat with with verified journalists. We create Apps that change how citizens and businesses communicate with journalists.

                            <p>
                                We aim to remove the limitations that spam email and social networks have put on contacting, discovering, following and sharing with journalists.
                            </p>

                                For citizens we've developed Smartphone Photo Sharing Apps. For businesses we've developed Press Page Web Apps.

                                    Newslinn was founded in 2014 by 3 co-founders - and the core citizen-to-journalist network
                                    launched in 2016.

                                    Our network is free for journalists and open for people to share any type of news,
                                    whether it's protests and activism or local community events and personal success stories.

                                    The current version of the platform focuses on sharing photos in real-time and incorporates a mixture of
                                    technology to aid in verification including artificial intelligence, two-factor user authentication,
                                    historical weather data and GPS location data.

                                    By providing a dedicated platform for sharing news we remove some of the risks people face when
                                    sharing news on social networks and some of the challenges journalists face with news verification.

                                    To sustain a dedicated news sharing platform we have developed Press Pages for organisations
                                    so that they can share company updates, information, photos and PR material with journalists
                                    on a closed-network that has been designed around the needs of journalists.
