            <p>Newslinn started as a research project in 2014 and is continuing to invest time in photo
                analysis, image verification and classification. Below is an overview of our existing research projects, the
                current status and if it's open or closed for external participation.</p>
        
            <p>For each research project we are making anonymous data sets available and making

            <h2>A short note on technology</h2>
            <p>
                Newslinn is a technology company. Our mission is to build the technology to help people around the
                World (in both low-tech and high-tech countries) to communicate easily and safely with journalists - and by doing so provide that technology for free
                as a platform for journalists. You can read more about our

            <h2>Project: Image Validation</h2>
            <h4>Patent Applied for S20150216, Digital Image Validation</h4>
            <p>As part of our image validation patent technology (Patent Applied S20150216), we are looking for collaborators and will be releasing the research
                and implementation under the <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT" target="_blank">MIT License</a>.
                Once the patent is pending we will be opening this project for external collaboration.</p>

            <h2>Project: Photo Classification</h2>
            <h4>Part of Enterprise Ireland Innovation Vouchers Scheme and open for Knowledge Providers in Ireland.</h4>
            <p>As part of our extension to our artificial intelligence rule engine we are researching on
                supervised classification for image fraud analysis for the prediction of acceptance of photos.</p>
            <p>The purpose is to use supervised classification to complement the existing rule engine and to predict if a
                photo should be 'accepted' or 'declined'.</p>
            <p>The project will last 6 months and we will be releasing an anonymized data set that will be open
            to external parties.</p>
            <p>* please note, no photos will be included in the data set.</p>

            <h2>Project: Photo Error Level Analysis</h2>
            <h4>Internal Research, open to external source code collaboration.</h4>
            <p>As part of our real-time fraud detection system we are conducting research into different ELA algorithms on a
            real-time photo data set.</p>
            <p>The end outcome will be a research paper on the different approaches and algorithms tests with a particular focus
            on real-time scalable and reliable algorithms.</p>
            <p>Our implementation will be using Python and source code will be released under the <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT" target="_blank">MIT License</a>.</p>

            <h4>Internal Research, open to external source code collaboration.</h4>
            <p>As part of our vision we are researching tooling to provide anonymous validated image sharing from sources.
            This will involve image encryption, steganography, user anonymization and combined our existing efforts on image verification.</p>
            <p>This project will be open-sourced with it's aim to be used by third party networks and media companies.</p>
